    Bulk delete all media files associated with given `media_objects` using GCS batch operations.

    This function optimizes deletion of multiple files by using Google Cloud Storage's batch
    operations. While the code uses a loop to collect delete operations, the actual HTTP
    requests are batched behind the scenes:

    1. Files are processed in chunks of 100 (GCS recommended batch size)
    2. For each chunk, a batch context is created
    3. Inside the batch context:
       - delete() calls don't execute immediately
       - instead, they are collected/queued up
    4. When the batch context exits:
       - all queued operations are sent in a single HTTP request
       - e.g., 100 deletes = 1 HTTP request (instead of 100 requests)

    Example:
        For 250 files, this results in:
        - Batch 1: 100 files -> 1 HTTP request
        - Batch 2: 100 files -> 1 HTTP request
        - Batch 3: 50 files -> 1 HTTP request
        Total: 3 HTTP requests (instead of 250)

    Note:
        - If media_objects is empty, function returns immediately without any operations
