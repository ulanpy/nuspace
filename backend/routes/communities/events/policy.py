class EventPolicy:
    """
    Event policy class for centralized permission checking and authorization control.

    This class focuses exclusively on permission and authorization checks, such as:
    - Who can create, read, update, or delete events
    - What roles have access to specific actions
    - Special permissions for community heads and admins

    **Note**
    This class should NOT handle logical data validation (e.g., whether a personal event can have a
    community_id). Such validations belong in the schema layer as they represent fundamental
    data model rules that apply regardless of user permissions. This class should only determine
    WHO can perform actions, not WHAT makes valid event data.

    **Example of schema/logical validations**
    - Personal events cannot have a community_id
    - Community events must have a community_id
    - Event datetime must be in the future
    - Event duration must be positive
    - Event name must not be empty

    **Example of permission checks(this class)**
    - Only admins can create events
    - Only community heads can update event status
    - Only event creators can delete their own events
